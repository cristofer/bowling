# README

This is a very simple API for setup a new Bowling game, and manage its scores.

You can see a live version here: https://free-bowling.herokuapp.com

It is quite simple, it does not manage teams just yet, or it does not have any interface for displaying the status of the game, as it was meant to be just an API; but for next steps adding a simple interface would be handy :)

There is a small documentation in the root of the project, to explain a bit about the endpoints.
