# README

This is a very simple API for setup a new Bowling game, and manage its scores.

You can see a live version here: https://free-bowling.herokuapp.com

It is quite simple, it does not manage teams just yet, but it displays the status of the game (total, frames).

There is a small documentation in https://free-bowling.herokuapp.com/apidoc/index.html, to explain a bit about the endpoints.
